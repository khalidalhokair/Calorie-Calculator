                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I chose a software engineering major for two professional reason, and also Psychological reason. The professional reason is that we have a need in the labor market for fairly good salaries. A desirable specialty is also required. My father has an information technology company, and this very helps me master and understand a major, and the other reason is that I love software engineering and programming Since a young age she has mastered her very well?</p>
